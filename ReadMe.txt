Thank you for purchasing this product.

NB: In order to run the project on your machine. 
Make sure you have installed a php server on your machine. 
I recommend xampp because it comes with PhP and MySQL. 
Check xampp for installation instructions (https://www.apachefriends.org/)

1. Extract the downloaded file to your server htdocs directory. 
2. Launch xampp and start Apache and mysql servers.
3. Open http://localhost/phpmyadmin and import the database.sql file.
4. Launch your project by visiting http://localhost/myexpenses

In case you encounter any problems, reach me at kimtooflex@gmail.com

Thank you & happy coding 🙂👍
